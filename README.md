> A Modern Web Application Framework

Building web applications used to be easy. Users would submit forms, you'd handle them on your backend, and all was good.

Over time applications moved from the server to the client because it provided a better user experience. You could update parts of the page instead of the whole page.

But in this switch, something happened. Your application became distributed. Your code size doubled. Your application became more brittle. Your code became littered with extra APIs, networking calls, caching and retries—all because you split your code base.

It doesn't have to be this way.

`Hummingbird.js` is a simple framework that makes it easy to build modern web applications. It's extremely opinionated, and relies on:

* JavaScript — Same language on frontend and backend, no cognitive overhead
* HTMX — Make client-side development look like server-side development
* Tailwind — Simple universal CSS building blocks
* Postgresql — A single database to handle everything
